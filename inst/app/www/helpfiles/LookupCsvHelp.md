### Lookup CSV Help

***

Use the browse button to select a comma separated file (.csv) which contains the categories that a user can select from when annotating.  This file should have two columns, 'display' and 'value'. The 'display' column contains the data that will be displayed in the dropdown and the 'value' column contains the data that will be written to the annotation file.
