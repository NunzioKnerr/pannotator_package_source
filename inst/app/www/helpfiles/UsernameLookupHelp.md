### User Name Lookup Help

***

Use the browse button to select a comma separated file (.csv) which contains the usernames that a user can select from when annotating.  This file should have two columns, 'user_name' and 'value'. The 'user_name' column contains the data that will be displayed in the dropdown and the 'value' column contains the data that will be written to the annotation file.
